# Expense Azure Functions
This is an experimentation on how to setup an API using Azure Functions and to store data using CosmosDB.

## Azure Functions

Using Azure Functions, it's possible to setup an API very similar the way .NET WebApi works, including dependency injection. 
The biggest benefit is cost: you only pay what you use, basically on on development you only going to use the free tier.

This project only make use of HTTP triggers.

## CosmosDB

The idea of this repository is to experiment with Azure Functions, as well as look into other providers to store data.
CosmosDB offers a similar way of working with databases.
